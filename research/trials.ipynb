A morning temperature of greater than 37.2ºC \\nand an evening temperature of greater than 37.7ºC is often considered as fever. Fever \\nmay be continuous, intermittent or remittent. However, with frequent self-medication \\nwith antipyretics, classic patterns are not generally seen.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt is important to work towards ﬁ  nding the cause of fever. A meticulous history of \\nchronology of symptoms, any associated focal symptom(s), exposure to infectious \\nagents and occupational history may be useful. A thorough physical examination \\nrepeated on a regular basis may provide potentially diagnostic clues such as rash, \\nlymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, abdominal tenderness, altered \\nsensorium, neck stiffness, lung crepts, etc. Drug fever should be considered when the \\ncause of fever is elusive.\\nDiagnostic tests\\nA large range of diagnoses may possibly be the cause of fever. If the history and \\nphysical examination suggest that it is likely to be more than a simple URI or viral \\nfever, investigations are indicated. The extent and focus of diagnostic work-up will \\ndepend upon the extent and pace of illness, diagnostic possibilities and the immune \\nstatus of the host. If there are no clinical clues, the work-up should include a complete \\nhaemogram with ESR, smear for malarial parasite, blood culture, Widal test, urine \\nanalysis including urine culture. If the febrile illness is prolonged beyond 2 weeks, an \\nX-ray chest is indicated even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Any abnormal \\nﬂ uid collection should be sampled. Ultrasonography is needed in some cases of acute \\nfever such as in amoebic liver abscess.\\nTreatment\\nRoutine use of antipyretics in low-grade fever is not justiﬁ ed. This may mask important \\nclinical indications. However, in acute febrile illnesses suggestive of viral or bacterial \\ncause, fever should be symptomatically treated. \\nChapter-01.indd   1Chapter-01.indd   1 11/9/2012   3:57:21 PM11/9/2012   3:57:21 PM'),\n",

FUO is usually an uncommon presentation \\nof common diseases. FUO are classiﬁ ed into four main categories along with common \\ncauses in each of these categories.\\n 1. Classic FUO—corresponds to the previous deﬁ nition except that instead of one \\nweek of investigations, it requires up to 3 outpatient visits or 3 days in the hospital, \\nviz. tuberculosis, abscesses, bacterial endocarditis, visceral leishmaniasis, non-\\nHodgkin’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, acute leukaemia, systemic lupus \\nerythromatosis.\\n 2.

Gram-negative bacterial, staphylococcal, central venous \\ncatheter infections, invasive fungal infections, dental abscesses, perianal infections, \\ncytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus infections.\\nIf patient does not ﬁ t into any of the above deﬁ nition, the patient should be referred \\nto a specialist for investigations and management. \\nSALIENT FEATURES\\n/circle6 Prolonged unexplained fever, often with no localizing clue on history, physical \\nexamination and basic laboratory investigations.\\nDiagnostic evaluation\\nA detailed clinical history and repeated and meticulous physical examination are \\nvaluable in providing potentially diagnostic clues (PDC) to the cause of fever in these \\npatients. No single algorithmic approach to diagnosis can be recommended for all \\npatients of FUO and diagnostic approach needs to be individualized.\\nA complete haemogram including peripheral blood smear for malarial parasite, \\nserum biochemistry particularly liver function tests, a tuberculin test and an X-ray of \\nchest should be done in every patient with prolonged fever. Other investigations which \\nare often helpful include tests related to collagen vascular disease; an ultrasonography \\nof abdomen to localize intra-abdominal foci of infections and a contrast enhanced \\ncomputed tomography (CECT) of chest and abdomen in detecting mediastinal lymph \\nnodes and parenchymal lung abnormalities not seen on conventional chest X-ray. \\nFurther, diagnostic approach should take into consideration the PDCs from the \\nevaluation of history, results of repeated physical examination, basic investigations \\nand any investigation done prior to this episode. If any abnormal or doubtful lesion is \\ndetected FNAC/biopsy should be obtained.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment will be based on the speciﬁ  c cause of fever. Thorough investigations \\ngenerally yield a speciﬁ c cause of fever in about 90% of patients. Sometimes evaluation \\nmay need discontinuation of all drugs being taken by the patient to rule out drug fever \\nas the cause of FUO.\\nSymptomatic treatment for fever (for details see section on fever). Sponging with \\nlukewarm water may be done, if fever produces discomfort. The emphasis in patients \\nwith classic FUO is on continued observation and examination.\\n(Caution: Avoid ‘shotgun’ trials. Empirical therapies consisting of therapeutic \\ntrials commonly used in patients with FUO are: Antibiotics, antitubercular treatment \\n(ATT) and corticosteroids). \\nChapter-01.indd   8Chapter-01.indd   8 11/9/2012   3:57:22 PM11/9/2012   3:57:22 PM'),\n",

Dizziness is classiﬁ ed in three categories: (1) faintness (syncope and \\npresyncopal symptoms), (2) vertigo and (3) miscellaneous head sensation. The common \\ncauses of vertigo include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular \\nneuronitis, chronic suppurative otitis media, Meniere’s disease, cervical spondylosis, \\ndrug-induced vertigo due to administration of aminoglycosides, furosemide, etc. \\nSystemic problems such as long-standing diabetes, hypertension may also be a \\ncausative factor.

Approximately 250-350 mg of bilirubin is \\nformed daily, mostly from the breakdown of aged RBCs (70-80%) and rest from other \\nhaem proteins in the marrow and liver. It is taken up by liver, conjugated and excreted \\nin bile. Serum bilirubin may increase due to derangement occurring at any level: \\nIncreased production due to excessive haemolysis, results in unconjugated  /circle6\\nhyperbilirubinaemia (>80% unconjugated serum bilirubin), jaundice is mild \\n(bilirubin <10 mg%) and associated with absence of bilirubin in urine (acholuric \\njaundice). \\nImpaired conjugation in hepatocellular damage (usually results in increase in  /circle6\\nboth fractions of bilirubin due to impaired conjugation and associated decreased \\ncanalicular excretion).\\nImpaired excretion due to intra- or extra-hepatic cholestasis, resulting in conjugated  /circle6\\nhyperbilirubinaemia (>50% conjugated serum bilirubin), associated with absence of \\nurobilinogen and bile salts in urine. \\nCommon causes of jaundice in clinical practice include acute viral hepatitis, \\nalcoholic hepatitis, chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, gallstones and malignancy of gallbladder/\\npancreas or extra-hepatic biliary system.

A dosage table based on  /circle6\\npatient’s weight could be printed on the card to ensure correct dosage for the child.\\nAssessment of response to therapy\\n 1. The short course chemotherapy as enlisted above leads to a rapid clinical response \\nin most patients in 2-4 weeks. Inadequate combination or dosage of this can lead \\nto emergence of resistance and should be avoided at all cost. \\n 2. The response to therapy should be monitored by bacteriological conversion in \\npositive cases and by other markers like clinical and/or radiological improvement \\nin AFB negative cases at the end of 2 months of intensive phase. A bacteriological \\nconversion in over 80% of cases after 2 months of therapy is expected. If the \\npatient continues to excrete bacteria after 2 months, the intensive phase needs to \\nbe extended by a month, and also ensure patient compliance, as non-adherence \\nis the most common cause for non-response. If a patient continues to be \\nsymptomatic or bacteriologically positive after an extended phase of IP, then the \\npatient should be extensively re-evaluated and treatment failure/drug resistance \\nshould be suspected. The patient should be referred to a higher centre for further \\nmanagement. Remember persistence or recurrence of symptoms or radiological \\nshadow could be due to secondary or coinfection with other organisms or due \\nto a non-tuberculous lesion. Radiological response may lag behind bacteriologic \\ncure and hence should not be the deciding factor for stopping of treatment. In \\npatients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, the response to treatment is assessed \\nclinically.\\n 3. All patients should have baseline LFTs; should be monitored regularly in patients \\nat high risk of hepatitis, e.g. old patients, alcoholics, diabetics and malnourished. \\n 4. Monitoring and management of side effects: The suggested therapy is usually well \\ntolerated. However, some patients can develop GI intolerance, vomiting, etc. for \\nwhich only symptomatic therapy is required. Commonest major side effect with \\nsuggested regime is drug-induced hepatitis. The easily recognizable symptom of \\nhigh-coloured urine in jaundiced patient is masked due to discolouration of urine \\nbecause of rifampicin. Suspect hepatitis, if vomiting is persistent and associated \\nwith anorexia. Clinically, icterus may be evident.

Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis particularly when used in high doses and \\nrequires omission of the drug once this side effect occurs.\\n 5. In case of hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue all drugs, re-challenge with \\nindividual drug to determine the likely offending drug. Do not reintroduce \\nrifampicin in patients who develop thrombocytopenia. Hyperuricaemia can occur \\ndue to pyrazinamide. Needs to be discontinued only in case of secondary gout.\\nPatient education\\nThe patients should be impressed upon the necessity of complying with periodic  /circle6\\nfollow-up sputum examination schedule as advised. \\nIn case patients experience any unusual symptoms after initiation/during treatment,  /circle6\\nthey should be instructed to approach the medical ofﬁ cer and report the same. On \\ntheir own, they should not take a decision either to stop or to continue the drugs.\\nSmoking of tobacco adversely affects the treatment outcome and, therefore, give  /circle6\\nsimple tips to quit smoking and refer to the smoking cessation clinic and protect \\nfrom passive smoking. The environment of the patient has to be smoke free at home/\\nofﬁ ce and at clinic. Check smoking status of the TB patient at every interaction. \\nAlcohol abuse: /circle6  Elicit history of addiction to alcohol and if found alcoholic, advise to \\nstrictly refrain from alcohol as it would increase the chances of patient developing \\nhepatitis (jaundice), irregularity in drug intake and adverse treatment outcome. \\nRifampicin colours the urine as well as other body secretions orange-red. Patient  /circle6\\nmust be warned about this to avoid unnecessary alarm. The patient should also be \\nadvised to take Rifampicin on an empty stomach and not to take any meals for about \\n1 hour afterwards for good absorption of the drug.\\nThe patient or the primary caregiver must be advised regarding the probable side  /circle6\\neffects and explained when to contact the treating doctor.\\nA health functionary should preferably supervise the treatment of tuberculosis as  /circle6\\nfar as possible. However, it is of utmost importance that the patient and the family \\nare informed about the need to complete all the treatment for whole of the duration. \\nThey must be explained the need for prolonged therapy even after the sickness \\ndisappears (symptoms abate). Inadequate or incomplete treatment increases the \\nchance of multidrug resistance which is difﬁ cult to treat.\\nImportance of screening symptomatic contacts and children below 6 years: /circle6  \\nEncourage patients to bring symptomatic adult contacts and all children aged \\nsix years and below for screening at health facility for early detection of cases \\namong them and appropriate treatment.

There are four plasmodia species: P . falciparum, P . vivax, \\nP . malariae, and P . ovale.\\nSALIENT FEATURES\\n/circle6 Malaria is an acute and chronic protozoan illness characterized by paroxysms \\nof fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, anaemia and splenomegaly. In atypical cases, \\nclassical symptoms may not manifest.\\n/circle6 Falciparum malaria (severe and complicated malaria) severe manifestations can \\ndevelop over a short span of 12-24 hours and is associated in varying degrees \\nwith the following clinical signs:\\n Cerebral: Mental clouding, coma, convulsions, delirium and occasionally \\nlocalizing signs. Hyperpyrexia (>40.5ºC), haemolysis, haematocrit <15% or \\nHb <5 g/dl, hypoglycaemia, oliguria, anuria, pulmonary oedema, macroscopic \\nhaemoglobinuria and jaundice. \\n/circle6 Diagnosis is made by presence of protozoa in the blood in thick and thin smear \\nslides. Thick smear for easy detection of parasite and thin smear for identiﬁ cation \\nof species. Note that blood ﬁ lms may be negative even in a severe attack because \\nof sequestration of parasites in the deep capillaries. Rapid diagnostic kits (RDK) \\ncan be used for detection of P . falciparum where microscopy results are not \\nobtainable within 24 hours of sample collection\\nTreatment of malaria\\n 1. All fever cases suspected to be malaria should be investigated by microscopy or \\nRDT.\\n 2. Patients of uncomplicated malaria can be managed at primary level but patients with \\nsevere malaria with complications should be admitted and managed in a hospital where \\nfacilities for detailed investigations and blood transfusion exist.\\nChapter-01.indd   31Chapter-01.indd   31 11/9/2012   3:57:22 PM11/9/2012   3:57:22 PM'),\n",

P . vivax cases should be treated with chloroquine for three days and Primaquine for 14 \\ndays. Primaquine is used to prevent relapse but is contraindicated in pregnant women, \\ninfants and individuals with G6PD deﬁ ciency. Note: Patients should be instructed to \\nreport back in case of haematuria or high-coloured urine/cyanosis or blue coloration of \\nlips and Primaquine should be stopped in such cases.

This is to be accompanied by single dose primaquine on day \\n2.\\n 5. Pregnant women with uncomplicated P . falciparum should be treated as follows:\\n1st trimester: Quinine /circle6\\n2nd & 3rd trimester: ACT /circle6\\nNote: Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnant woman.\\n 6. In cases where parasitological diagnosis is not possible due to non-availability of \\neither timely microscopy or RDT, suspected malaria cases should be treated with \\nfull course of chloroquine, till the results of microscopy are received. Once the \\nparasitological diagnosis is available, appropriate treatment as per the species, is \\nto be administered.\\n 7. Presumptive treatment with chloroquine is no more recommended.\\n 8.

Total leucocytes count is either normal or \\ndecreased. Platelet count is less than normal.\\n• Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), if one or more of the following are present: \\nPositive tourniquet test, petechiae, ecchymosis or purpura, bleeding from mucosa, \\ninjection or other sites, haematemesis or melaena, thrombocytopenia (platelets \\n100,000/mm3 or less) and evidence of plasma leakage. \\n• Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). All the above criteria of DHF plus signs of \\ncirculatory failure.\\nNote: The tourniquet test is performed by inﬂ  ating a blood pressure cuff to a point \\nmid-way between the systolic and diastolic pressures for 5 minutes. A test is considered \\npositive, when 10 or more petechiae per 2.5 cm2 are observed. In DHF, the test usually \\ngives a deﬁ nitive positive result (i.e. >20 petechiae). The test may be negative or mildly \\npositive during the phase of profound shock.\\nTreatment\\nDF/DHF has an unpredictable course. Most patients have a febrile phase lasting 2-7 \\ndays followed by a critical phase (2-3 days), during this phase, the patient is afebrile \\nand is at risk of developing DHF/DSS. A patient can progress from DHF to DSS \\nand depending on the stage of the disease when the patient reports, a mixed picture \\ncan be seen. DHF is classiﬁ ed into four grades of severity, where grades III and \\nIV are considered to be DSS. The presence of thrombocytopenia with concurrent \\nhaemoconcentration differentiates grades I and II DHF from DF.\\nGrade I : Fever accompanied by non-speciﬁ  c constitutional symptoms; the only \\nhaemorrhagic manifestation is a positive tourniquet test and/or easy \\nbruising.\\nGrade II : Spontaneous bleeding in addition to the manifestations of grade I patients, \\nusually in the form of skin or other haemorrhages.\\nGrade III : Circulatory failure manifested by a rapid, weak pulse and narrowing of \\npulse pressure or hypotension, with the presence of cold, clammy skin and \\nrestlessness.\\nGrade IV : Profound shock with undetectable blood pressure or pulse.\\nChapter-01.indd   36Chapter-01.indd   36 11/9/2012   3:57:23 PM11/9/2012   3:57:23 PM'),\n",

Each episode of neurologic dysfunction is called a seizure. Isolated non- \\nrecurrent seizures may occur in otherwise healthy individuals for a variety of reasons, \\nand under these circumstances, the individual is not said to have epilepsy.\\nSALIENT FEATURES\\nA seizure (convulsion) is deﬁ ned as a paroxysmal involuntary disturbance of brain \\nfunction that may manifest as an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal \\nmotor activity, behavioural abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic \\ndysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss \\nor impairment of consciousness.\\n/circle6 Diagnosis should be made by a description of the seizure(s) from the patient and \\nwitnesses about frequency, symptoms during and following attacks, duration, \\ncircumstances and trigger factors, injury, tongue biting and incontinence. \\n/circle6 Diagnostically relevant factors are seizure types, age at onset (many epilepsies \\nare age-speciﬁ c), family history, past history of head injury, febrile convulsions, \\nprecipitating factors, e.g. photic stimulation, alcohol and other drug intake, EEG \\nfor evidence of generalized or focal abnormality. \\n/circle6 CT/MRI for evidence of structural lesion. \\n/circle6 Consider differential diagnosis of vasovagal syncope, nonepileptic attack disorder \\n(pseudo seizures), migraine and breathholding spells, etc.\\nChapter-01.indd   48Chapter-01.indd   48 11/9/2012   3:57:23 PM11/9/2012   3:57:23 PM'),\n",

Long-term \\ntreatment is required for recurrent seizures. First episode of seizures with no previous \\nhistory of same or other types of seizures and where neurological and metabolic \\ndiseases are ruled out, may be kept under observation and are not treated unless parents/\\npatients are not willing to take the risk. However, patients presenting with status \\nepilepticus, partial seizures, Todd’s palsy, strong family history of epilepsy and with \\nabnormal CT head and EEG have a higher risk of recurrence and can be put on long-\\nterm therapy after ﬁ rst seizure. For alcohol withdrawal and metabolic or drug related \\nseizures, long-term treatment is considered only if there are recurrences suggestive \\nof epilepsy. Treatment for seizures following head injury should be initiated after \\nﬁ rst seizure. However, duration of treatment depends on risk of late epilepsy.

Measure PEFR/PFTs in \\nolder children and record the assessed status of disease.\\nIf there is no improvement or deterioration, look for possible cause such as \\npoor compliance, wrong technique of inhalation, continued use of empty canister, \\ninappropriate doses, infection (otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonitis), continued exposure \\nto allergens, under assessment of illness in previous visit, allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. \\nIf no cause is found, a step up may be considered, i.e. increase in dose and frequency \\nof medication.\\nStep down the medications, if control is sustained for at least 3 months and follow \\na gradual stepwise reduction in treatment. When deciding which drug to step down \\nﬁ rst and at what rate, the severity of asthma, the side effects of treatment, the beneﬁ cial \\neffect achieved, and the patients’ preference should all be taken into account. Patients \\nshould be maintained at the lowest possible dose of inhaled steroid. Reduction in \\ninhaled steroid dose should be slow as patients deteriorate at different rates.\\nHome treatment of acute exacerbation\\n 1. Identify acute exacerbation by increase in cough, wheeze and breathlessness. \\n 2. Measure PEFR (if feasible), if decreased by 15% from the baseline, administer \\nSalbutamol by MDI with spacer with or without facemask, one puff at a time, \\nrepeated every 2-4 minutes up to a maximum of 10-20 puffs with monitoring of \\nsymptoms.\\nIf symptoms are relieved and PEFR is increased at the end of inhalation, continue \\non Salbutamol/Terbutaline every 4-6 hours and a visit to treating physician should be \\nplanned.\\nIf there is no improvement or partial improvement or there are symptoms of life-\\nthreatening attack (severe distress, difﬁ culty in speech, feeding, cyanosis, exhaustion) \\nat any time, the patient should be immediately transferred to a hospital and during \\ntransportation continue inhaled Salbutamol/Terbutaline and give a dose of prednisolone \\n(1-2 mg/kg).\\nAntibiotics\\nAntibiotics should not be given routinely for acute asthma. Antimicrobial treatment is \\nindicated, however, when there is persistent fever and other signs of pneumonia such \\nas bronchial breathing. Mere presence of crackles is not an evidence of pneumonia and \\ndoes not warrant antibiotics.\\nPatient/parent education\\nExplain the nature and pathogenesis of asthma in simple language. /circle6\\nEmphasize that there is a wide-spectrum of severity of asthma and that most patients  /circle6\\ncan lead active and normal life.\\nChapter-01.indd   66Chapter-01.indd   66 11/9/2012   3:57:23 PM11/9/2012   3:57:23 PM'),\n",

A record of sleep disturbances, absence from school due to illness \\nand medication is required to keep the patient symptom free.\\nEnvironmental control to avoid precipitating factors is equally important. /circle6\\nPatient/parents should avoid dusting (wet mopping is preferred), when children are  /circle6\\naround.\\nAvoid using carpets, stuffed toys, open bookshelves, smoking and chemical sprays  /circle6\\nin the house. Mosquito nets should be preferred over repellents.\\nFood with chemicals like preservatives/colouring agents should be avoided. /circle6\\nInhalation technique: It is best to use MDI with spacers, however, if low dose  /circle6\\nsteroids are being given then dry powder inhaler can also be used. MDI must be \\nshaken well before inhalation. It is then attached to spacer (commercial/indigenous \\nmade from plastic bottle) and patient is asked to inhale 3-4 times slowly and deeply \\njust when the drug is released by activation of MDI. \\nPatient/parents must be advised to check the canister every few days dipping it in a  /circle6\\ntumbler full of water. An empty canister ﬂ oats. \\nThe spacer should be cleaned monthly with detergent and dried in air. The  /circle6\\nmouthpiece should be wiped clean of detergent before use.\\nReferences\\n 1.
